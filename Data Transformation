#Take Log - useful when you have variables that can go from very small to very large
df['variable_log'] = np.log(df['variable'])

#Take square root
df['variable_sqrt'] = np.sqrt(df['variable'])

You can use one or both and let the model decide

#Interactions: A variable may not have a strong predictive power, but when combined with other variable, it can improve its predictive power
